# MysteriousIslandGame
This game was written sometime in early 2021 when I was learning functions in Python. I wanted to test my understanding of everything I had learnt in Python to that point.

The game follows an easy sequence:

The player is a pirate and is shipwrecked with a co pirate, 'Old Johnnie' in an unknown island full of riches. As greedy as any pirate would be, they start out on a quest to know who would get the most riches.

Each spins a magic wheel to uncover riches (the player is prompted to press a range of numbers to spin his).

At the start of the game, the player is asked if he wants to undertake the mission. He can give any of a range of answers ('yeah', 'yes', 'yaddah', 'oui' etc).

The player can also quit the game by typing any of 'quit', 'stop', 'end'.
